# The Plane Game
This project has taken around 6-8 months of full-time development. It is an arcade game now released on Android and iOS for free, with no ads or microtransactions.

I wanted to create a game that would stand out, and not be a cash grab like the majority of apps on the store. By releasing this for free with no ads or revenue generation, I aimed to give something back to the community.

I started this project to teach myself C# through hands-on methods. Before starting the project, I had never touched C#. I am now confident with this language.

All assets within this project are my creation. I challenged myself to do it all myself, and had to learn how to create art and music along the way (which proved to be a real challenge indeed).

My biggest lesson from this project was of scope creep. My initial design plan was not comprehensive enough and so I came up with features as I went along. This was a mistake. I put more features into this game than I would have if I realised the complexity and time cost it would take. Nevertheless, I have learnt my lesson and will take this experience with me throughout my future projects.
